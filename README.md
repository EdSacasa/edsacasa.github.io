  <p align="center">
    In this project, we’ll get the chance to build a responsive website. We’ll be cloning The Next Web, a tech-focused    magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.</p>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Responsive design is creating websites that respond to the user’s context, whether that is the device they are viewing on, the size of their browser, or their accessibility needs. Lucky for you, there are lots of good tools that help you easily start making websites responsive. It’s not rocket science to do a pretty good job at a responsive site, though it’s a lot more work to get one that really nails it.
